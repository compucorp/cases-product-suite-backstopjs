# Developer Guide

This test suite is customised for angular app specific to civicase, so it uses some custom prorperties on top

```
waitForAjaxComplete             // Set to true if any event (click/hover) loads some content through AJAX
isUIBPopover                    // Set to true if the hover state opens a uib popover
```
